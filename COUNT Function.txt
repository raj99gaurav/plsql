Examples of Collection Method COUNT ( )

Example 1: Compute total number of elements stored in a Nested table.

You can use COUNT ( ) function to compute total number of elements stored into a collection such as Nested table.

SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
    TYPE my_nested_table IS TABLE OF number;
    var_nt my_nested_table := my_nested_table (9,18,27,36,45,54,63,72,81,90);
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('The Size of the Nested Table is ' ||var_nt.count);
END;
/
Go ahead; copy and paste the above code in your IDE and see the result.

Example 2. COUNT ( ) function with IF Condition

You can use COUNT ( ) function to control the flow of the program using a condition. So let’s write a very simple program which will demonstrate how to use collection Method COUNT ( ) with IF Condition.

SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
    TYPE my_nested_table IS TABLE OF number;
    var_nt my_nested_table := my_nested_table (9,18,27,36,45,54,63,72,81,90);
BEGIN
    IF var_nt.count >= 10 THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (‘you have already inserted 10 elements in your Nested table.');
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('Are you sure you want to insert more?');
    END IF;
END;
