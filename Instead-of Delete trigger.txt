Instead-of Delete trigger Example.

In this example I will again use the View VW_Rgvlogs which we created earlier and have consistently used in this Instead-of trigger series so far.

Needless to say that executing DELETE DML on this view will return an error because of its non-updatable nature. Thus the only way to perform DELETE DML on this view is by using an Instead of trigger. Letâ€™s quickly create one.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER io_delete
INSTEAD OF DELETE ON vw_Rgvlogs
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM trainer WHERE FULL_NAME = :old.FULL_NAME;
  DELETE FROM subject WHERE SUBJECT_NAME= :old.SUBJECT_NAME;
END;
