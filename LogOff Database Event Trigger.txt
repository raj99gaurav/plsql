Step 1: Logon to the database
Logon to the database using any user such as HR, SH, OE or any other you want.

C:\> SQLPLUS hr/hr

Step 2: Create a table.
Create a table to dump the data generated by your schema level logoff trigger.

CREATE TABLE hr_evnt_audit
 (
  event_type VARCHAR2(30),
  logon_date DATE,
  logon_time VARCHAR2(15),
  logof_date DATE,
  logof_time VARCHAR2(15)
 );
Step 3: Write the trigger.
Below written trigger will execute every time user HR logs off from the database.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER log_off_audit
BEFORE LOGOFF ON SCHEMA
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO hr_evnt_audit VALUES(
    ora_sysevent,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    SYSDATE,
    TO_CHAR(sysdate, 'hh24:mi:ss')
  );
  COMMIT;
END;

Example: How To Create Database Level Logoff event Trigger In Oracle PL/SQL
Creation process of Database Level Logoff Event Trigger is pretty similar to the trigger which we just saw except for a few minute changes.

Step 1: Logon to the database
As only the user with ADMINISTER DATABASE TRIGGER system privilege can create a database level event trigger thus we need to make sure that this time we should log on to the database using one of these users.

C:\> SQLPLUS / as SYSDBA

Step 2: Create a Table
Again in order to store the audit data we need to create a table where this trigger will journal the entries of all the users. The structure of the table will be pretty similar to the above one except one extra column for storing the username with the help of which we can clearly identify the details and avoid the confusion.

CREATE TABLE db_evnt_audit
  (
User_name VARCHAR2(15),
    event_type VARCHAR2(30),
    logon_date DATE,
    logon_time VARCHAR2(15),
    logof_date DATE,
    logof_time VARCHAR2(15)
  );
Step 3: Write the Database Level logoff system event trigger.
Following Trigger will keep an eye on the logoff activity of the user of the database.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER db_lgof_audit
BEFORE LOGOFF ON DATABASE
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO db_evnt_audit 
  VALUES(
    user,
    ora_sysevent,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    SYSDATE,
    TO_CHAR(sysdate, 'hh24:mi:ss')
    );
END;
