Syntax of Instead-Of Trigger

CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
INSTEAD OF operation
ON view_name
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
	---Your SQL Codeâ€”
END;
/


Examples

Instead-of Insert Trigger

Instead-of trigger can be best demonstrated using a View joining two or more tables. Thus in this example I will create two simple tables and will then create a view over them. After that I will create an Instead of trigger for Insert operation on this view.

Step1: Create Tables

Table 1- trainer

CREATE TABLE trainer
  ( 
    full_name VARCHAR2(20)
  );

Table 2- Subject

CREATE TABLE subject
  ( 
    subject_name VARCHAR2(15)
  );
Insert dummy data into the above tables

INSERT INTO trainer VALUES ('Raj Gaurav');
INSERT INTO subject VALUES ('Oracle');

Step 2: Create View

In this step I will create a view which will show you the combined result of the data from the two tables above.

CREATE VIEW vw_rgvlogs AS
SELECT full_name, subject_name FROM trainer, subject;

This is a non-updatable view which you can confirm by executing any DML statement over it. Error as a result of DML operation on this view will be your confirmation.

Step 3: Create Trigger

Next I will create an Instead-of Insert trigger over the view vw_rgvlogs that we created in step 2.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER tr_Io_Insert
INSTEAD OF INSERT ON vw_rgvlogs 
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO trainer (full_name) VALUES (:new.full_name);
  INSERT INTO subject (subject_name) VALUES (:new.subject_name);
END

On successful execution, this trigger will insert a new row of data into both the underlying tables of the view vw_rgvlogs .You can confirm that by executing an insert DML over the view.
