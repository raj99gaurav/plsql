How to Call PL/SQL Stored Procedures in Oracle Database
After successfully creating and compiling the stored procedure, next you have to call this subroutine. You can do so in multiple ways such as:

Call a PL/SQL stored procedure using EXECUTE statement.
Call a PL/SQL stored procedure using an Anonymous PL/SQL block.
Call a PL/SQL stored procedure using a Named PL/SQL block.
**If in case your subroutine such as stored procedure consists of server side  PL/SQL statement then do make sure to set the “Server Output On” to see the result.

Call a PL/SQL stored procedure using EXECUTE statement
The best way to quickly check the output of your stored procedure or test the working of your PL/SQL procedure is to call it using EXECUTE keyword. In order to call a stored procedure using EXECUTE keyword you simply have to write the same keyword followed by the name of the procedure.

EXECUTE pr_rgvlogs;
Or you can also write the first 4 letters of the EXECUTE keyword followed by the procedure name.

EXEC pr_rgvlogs; 
Both the statements are the same and will do the same work.

Call a PL/SQL stored procedure using an Anonymous PL/SQL block
The second way of calling a procedure is to place a procedure call statement inside the execution section of an anonymous PL/SQL block.

BEGIN
  pr_rgvlogs;
END;
