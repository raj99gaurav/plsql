Instead-Of Update Trigger

Instead-of update trigger will override the default behavior of your update operation when you execute the update statement and will let you update the data of the underlying tables over which your view is created.

Example:
Tables (Trainer and Subject) and View (VW_rgvlogs) used in this example are the same as the ones we created in last one.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER io_update
INSTEAD OF UPDATE ON vw_rgvlogs
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  UPDATE trainer SET FULL_NAME = :new.full_name 
  WHERE FULL_NAME = :old.full_name;
  UPDATE subject SET subject_NAME = :new.subject_name 
  WHERE subject_NAME = :old.subject_name;
END;
